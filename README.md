# Frequency Domain Image Analysis

This repository contains academic projects focused on frequency-domain analysis of images using the Fourier Transform (FFT). The work explores how spatial structures, noise, and image content are represented in the frequency domain.

The project includes experiments on synthetic images as well as medical images, demonstrating practical applications of frequency-domain filtering for image enhancement and noise suppression.

## Topics Covered
- 2D Fourier Transform and FFT spectrum interpretation
- Relationship between spatial patterns and frequency components
- Effects of noise in the frequency domain
- Low-pass and high-pass filtering
- Band-stop filtering for periodic noise removal
- Frequency-domain analysis of medical images

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- NumPy
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib
- scikit-image

## Notes
This project was developed for academic and educational purposes as part of medical imaging and signal processing coursework.
